# Cleanserr-Discord-Bot
Neoteric Discord Bot made using DiscordJS &amp; NodeJS.

The Cleanserr Discord Bot allows users to manipulate a variety of integrated functions through bot commands with the intention of providing a more user-friendly experience to Discord users. The bot's built-in functions allow users to clear up a Discord chat to make it look like as if no one had ever typed! Additionally, users can activate a number of auxiliary commands such as the option to delete a number of specified messages from chat. Cleanserr also includes advanced features including built in security protection to make sure unwanted users do not get a hold of bot commands and customizable roles for who can use the bot, which server admins can control.
